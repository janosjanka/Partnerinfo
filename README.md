# Partnerinfo
Partnerinfo is an Online Marketing System with modern SPA-based CMS services (client-side routing, JavaScript modules, blazing fast, modern web designer, ...). In contrast to most of online marketing systems, it does not force you to use any built-in, unchangable business functions. You are totally free to define your own business activities and build business workflows for your web actions. What does it contain?

## Lightweight Workflow Engine & Activity Designer

- Extensible workflow engine developed for fast, performance-critical web actions
- Standard control flow & business activities (sequence, condition, redirect, schedule, subscribe, sendMail, tagging, ...)
- HTML-based workflow activity designer for marketing specialists

## Action Links

You can create action links where each link can be associated with a workflow defined by you. You can add a custom URI segment to the end of action links to make those user-friendly, moreover, you can also specify a contact to be able to measure even an action link shared on a social media site with your friends or girl-friends :-)

## Contact Management

The system enables you to easly get visitors supporting most of market leader social media authentication systems (e.g. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, ...) or even using custom form subscriptions. Furthermore, it contains a business tagging system which enables you to add/remove (colored) tags from your contacts and send newsletters or perform some business operation based on your business tag-based rules. For instance, when a user click your YouTube video link on a page, you can add a business tag 'He/she has seen the 1st video' to the contact with a redirect action to the next video page.

## Newsletter Management

Marketing specialists can send an arbitrary number of newsletters specifying a group of contacts or even business tag filters. Both token replacement and background processing are supported.
