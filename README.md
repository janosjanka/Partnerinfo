# Partnerinfo (www.partnerinfo.tv)
Partnerinfo is an Online Marketing System with modern SPA-based CMS services (client-side routing, modules, blazing fast HTML designer, ...). In contrast to most of similar systems, it does not force you to use pre-defined, built-in, and unchangable business functions. You are totally free to define your own business activities and build business workflows for your web actions. This project aimed to cover the following areas:

## Lightweight Server-Side Workflow Engine & Client-Side HTML Activity Designer

- Extensible workflow engine developed for fast, performance-critical web actions
- Standard control flow & business activities (sequence, condition, redirect, schedule, subscribe, sendMail, tagging, ...)
- HTML-based workflow activity designer for marketing specialists

## Action Links

You can create action links where each link can be associated with a workflow defined by you. You can add a custom URI segment to the end of action links to make those user-friendly, moreover, you can also specify a contact to be able to measure user-specific events outside of your system pages. You can even share an action link with your girl friend on a social media site to get info about what she is doing now :-)

## Contact Management

The system enables you to easily get visitors supporting most of market leader social media authentication systems (e.g. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, ...) or even using custom form subscriptions. Furthermore, it contains a business tagging system which enables you to add/remove (colored) tags from your contacts and send newsletters or perform some business operation based on your business tag-based rules. For instance, when someone clicks your YouTube video on your page, you can add a business tag 'He/she has seen the 1st video' to the contact with a redirect action to the next video page.

## Newsletter Management

You can send an arbitrary number of newsletters specifying a group of contacts or even business tag filters. Both token replacement and background processing are supported.
