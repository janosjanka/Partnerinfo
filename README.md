# Partnerinfo
Partnerinfo is an Online Marketing System with modern SPA-based CMS services (client-side routing, JavaScript modules, blazing fast, modern web designer, ...). In contrast to most of online marketing systems, it does not force you to use any built-in, unchangable business functions. You are totally free to define your own business activities and build business workflows for your web actions. What does it contain?

## Lightweight Workflow Engine & Activity Designer

- Extensible workflow engine developed for fast, performance-critical web actions
- Standard control flow & business activities (sequence, condition, redirect, schedule, subscribe, sendMail, tagging, ...)
- HTML-based workflow activity designer for marketing specialists

## Action Links

You can create action links where each link can be associated with a workflow defined by you. You can add a custom URI segment to the end of action links to make those user-friendly, moreover, you can also specify a contact to be able to measure even an action link shared on a social media site with your friends or girl-friends :-)
