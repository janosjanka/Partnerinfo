# Partnerinfo (www.partnerinfo.tv)
Partnerinfo is an Online Marketing System with modern SPA-based CMS services (client-side routing, modules, blazing fast HTML designer, JavaScript module system, ...). In contrast to most of similar systems, it does not force you to use pre-defined, built-in, and unchangable business functions. You are totally free to define your own business activities and build business workflows for your web actions. This project aimed to cover the following areas:

## Lightweight Server-Side Workflow Engine & Client-Side HTML Activity Designer

- Extensible workflow engine developed for fast, performance-critical web actions
- Standard control flow & business activities (sequence, condition, redirect, schedule, subscribe, sendMail, tagging, ...)
- HTML-based workflow activity designer for end-users, marketing specialists

## Action Links

An action link is a simple URL associated with a server-side workflow which can be called by executing a usual ASP.NET Web API action. When a user clicks a link or posts form data performing either HTTP GET or POST requests, the WF engine invokes the specified workflow passing context data (identity, user agent, user data and other information) into it.

You can even add a custom URI segment to the end of action links to make those user-friendly or specify a contact for each action link to be able to measure activity of a given user, including your girl-friend :-)

## Contact Management & Tagging

The system enables you to easily get visitors supporting most of market leader social media authentication systems (e.g. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, ...) or even using custom forms. Furthermore, it contains a business tagging system which enables you to add/remove (colored) tags from your contacts and send newsletters or perform some business operation based on your business tag-based rules. For instance, when someone clicks your YouTube video on your page, you can add a business tag 'He/she has seen the 1st video' extending it with a redirect action to the next video page. No hard-coded business actions !!!

## Newsletter Management

You can send an arbitrary number of newsletters specifying a group of contacts or even business tag filters. Both token replacement and background processing are supported.

## Content Management

You can easily create both layout and landing pages with a few clicks as you can do it in most of content management systems. This is not a big deal :-) The most important thing is that Partnerinfo uses pure JavaScript modules instead of slow server-side modules. If you are an SPA or experienced JavaScript developer, you will prefer a more user-experience oriented, JavaScript-based module system to legacy CMS modules.
